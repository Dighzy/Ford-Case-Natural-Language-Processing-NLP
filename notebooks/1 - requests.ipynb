       "   'summary': 'Over the past 4 months the powertrain malfunction light has illuminated 4 times on random occasions. The first time it came on while I was driving home from shopping. I did not notice the light until I stalled in the intersection trying to get on to the interstate. Stopped at the Ford dealership and insisted they scan it while the light was on. They refused and kept it for 2 days to tell me there was nothing wrong. Two weeks later, I was again traveling at an average speed. The light illuminated. Stopped at Advanced Auto Parts as it was late evening and Ford was closed. They could not pull a code with the light on stating it could be electrical. Towed the car home on a trailer from 45 minutes away. Upon inspection we discovered the coolant was low, added coolant and light went away. No issues for 3 months after that. The third time it came on I was accelerating on to the interstate. The engine was still pretty cold. The car went into limp mode and struggled to accelerate to highway speed. I parked the car and the light went away after sitting for a few hours. I thought it could be the oil was low or dirty. Took vehicle for oil change at Ford and they could see the light triggering but no code. Light did not come back for about 3 weeks. Fourth time I was driving at an average speed. Light came on and I was able to take vehicle directly to Ford again. Ford scanned the car while running with the light on and got a code for throttle/pedal sensor issues. The throttle position sensor was changed in July 2023. The car is currently at Ford awaiting a diagnosis and replacement of the issue. The powertrain light illuminating is a repeated issue with this vehicle.',\n",

After shifting back into Drive the vehicle went limp and had limited torque slowing down to speeds lower than 30mph it then came to an abrupt stop and refused to go into gear, as we noticed the vehicle's engine seems to shut off it seemed to suddenly enter into a neutral state and began to move slower than 30mph and we steered the vehicle into a nearby gas station, thankfully barely making it into the rest stop before the vehicle locked into an emergency brake position and wouldn't allow us to return it to drive or out of any gear other than neutral. In neutral it would move a few feet then return to an emergency braking position with all four tires locked and the emergency brake light coming on and refusing to go off even when we diseganged the emergency brake, rendering the vehicle immobile.     We were lucky to be able to make it off the freeway without having anyone crash into us with vehicles passing us at speeds greater than 70mph and our vehicle dropping to lower than 30mph and locking into a neutral position, thankfully we were able to make it to the nearest exit and call for help.

       "   'summary': 'Our 2021 Ford Escape has \"Intelligent\" adaptive cruise control. It has the capacity to adjust our car speed based on the highway speed limit signs it encounters. It reads all speed correctly but it also reads \"black and white, square, numeric, County Road signs as Speed Signs. This is dangerous as many County Road signs have numerics that drastically exceed the posted speed limit and cause the car to rapidly excellerate around a curve or in neighborhood settings. So for example, in a 35 mph speed zone, the car sees the County Road 85 sign and rapidly attempts to excelerate by 50 mph to 85 mph. This surprises you and forces you to seek the brake pedal in an attempt to avoid a casualty.  We have reported this to Ford and brought our vehicle in twice now regarding the issue. On 10/5/22 Ford replaced the car\\'s image module to help clarify highway signs for adaptive cruise. This did not remedy the problem. After nearly running over an animal because of this issue, we brought the car back to Ford on 5/8/24 to correct this issue under our nearly expired warranty. They had our vehicle for 3 weeks. We furnished them with photos of the County Road signs the car\\'s speed was erroneously triggered by, such as Co Rd 85 or 106! After much research with Ford International, the dealer determined that this is a software bug. On a recent \"on-line\" Ford document, on page 289, it states \"Note: The system may not detect all speed signs and may incorrectly read signs.\" This can occur when the county road signs are similar in shape and color to a speed limit sign. This is a limitation of the system and currently cannot be avoided or corrected.\" Please understand this information is not listed in our 2021 Escape Owners Manual. Furthermore, on the 2024 Escape loaner vehicle we had for 3 weeks while ours was in the shop, Ford changed out their adaptive cruise control system from \"Intelligent to Predictive\" which now uses GPS to compensate. Meanwhile our car remains a hazard to drive. Help!',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Safety Recall Notice 23S27 - Engine Failure - How does UPDATING THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE fix an internal engine manufacturing problem?    Does this correct the internal engine manufacturing issue with these vehicles?   Or is this just a fire prevention issue?  This fix seems similar to the previous fix of drilling holes in the pan under the engine to allow the leaking oil to drain out, thereby preventing a fire.   This fix appears to be a band-aid to avoid correcting the original engine manufacturing issue by forcing the engine to shut down before the oil leaks out.     Recall Reference Number: 22S47 Isolated engine manufacturing issues have resulted in engine failures involving engine block or oil pan breach on certain 2020—2023 Ford Escape and 2022—2023 Maverick vehicles with 2.5L HEV/PHEV engines. In the event of an engine block or oil pan breach, the HEV/PHEV system continues to propel the vehicle allowing the customer to continue to drive the vehicle. As the customer continues to drive after a block breach, oil and/or fuel vapor continues to be expelled and accumulates near ignition sources primarily expected to be the exhaust system.  This recall appears to be a way for Ford to avoid fixing these engine issues permanently.  I mostly drive locally (2021 Ford Escape with 17,500 miles) because I don't want to get stuck on an interstate highway 500 miles from home.   I have seen no documentation on how this helps owners feels safe when traveling away from home.\",\n",

The door is also starting to have issues closing all the way once it is attempted to shut the door.

They wouldn't even make an appointment to confirm which part was the issue. When we took it to Kia, which is the deal we bought the vehicle from, they see in their system that it is a part that has a recall and to take it to ford for a whole door replacement.

The issue is that there is a potential defect in the front door weld, which may cause the door to unexpectedly open while the vehicle is in motion, posing a significant safety risk to the driver, passengers, and other road users.  My door pops and creaks and squeals every time the door is opened and the hinge seizes up.  This is an operational as well as a safety issue, and the door has been reported in other cases to come open unexpectedly as there is a defect in the weld on the hinge of the driver door.',\n",

We were driving up a hill at around 70mph and in response to the engine noise, slowed the vehicle to a stop and turned off the engine. The vehicle was towed to a Ford service center where we were told that the engine was completely out of oil and had been destroyed. We did not get any alerts or warnings from the vehicle prior to the high revving sound.  According to Ford recall 23S27 and NHTSA recall 23V380, this is a known issue and could have put our family at significant risk.  We spoke to many people at Ford but they denied warranty coverage due to \"improper oil filter installation\". We were without our vehicle for 2 months before we decided to have another mechanic give an estimate and complete the repairs. The repair was a full engine replacement costing $7,000+.  Ford has since refused to reimburse us for the repair costs.  The incident occurred on 10/6/23 with around 52,000 miles. The vehicle was purchased new on 10/24/21.',\n",

The spot welds at the check arm attachment points on the driver door have failed. This has lead to a horrible noise and feeling when opening and closing our door. Sometimes the door does not shut all the way making this a safety issue. The door is now hard to open and close. The window is also inoperable as it either won't roll down at all or, if it does roll down, it will now roll back up.  This issue has been inspected by 2 dealerships and they are not allowing our PremiumCARE extended Warranty to cover this. We have had 10's of Escapes with 100,000+ miles and this has never been an issue.   This has occurred in this 2021 Escape and 2 of our other 2020 Ford Escapes (I will file complaints separately for them so NHTSA understands this is a massive issue Ford needs to fix ASAP and reimburse any customers who have paid out of pocket to get this fixed).   NHTSA needs to issue a recall immediately.\",\n",

My car continues to get worse and my 3 year warranty to my vehicle is up in March of 2024. As a consumer I should not have to be put in this position. This is not only unfair but dangerous to travel on the highway. I should of been given a new vehicle and Ford Motor Company should be responsible to not allowing for this to continue. I am respectfully asking you have Ford Motor Company to furnish me a new vehicle or give me an additional 3 year warranty on my vehicle with no additional costs. This burden should not be put onto the consumer and even if they find a remedy there is no guarantee this will resolve the problem.

They laughed at me and said that would never happen. After two visits, they realized the weld had broken on the door and said they would order a new one. They said they had never seen that on a passenger vehicle. It took 12 weeks for the door to arrive and they first said they would cover the rental vehicle and then came back the next day and said they would not cover a rental vehicle even when I said I felt unsafe driving it. So I kept driving it because it was my only vehicle. Ford Corporate tried to charge me $571.00 to pay for my part of the repair. They also dismissed that it was a larger problem. I have documentation regarding these interactions. The dealer stepped in and covered my portion of the repair. After they replaced the door, I reported the door appeared to be falling of the hinges and they investigated and said because they do not replace doors at the dealership often, they improperly installed the door as one of the hinge bolts was already missing. In April, 2023, I traded my 2021 Escape in for a 2022 Escape as I did not feel safe because of the door and the dealer agreed. It cost an additional $5,000 to get out of the lease, but it was worth my safety.',\n",

       "   'summary': '2021 escape purchased  on 10/12/21. By the end of October my vehicle began stalling while driving. The transmission was unable to change gears when the vehicle was accelerating or decelerating. While making a right turn my vehicle almost stalled out in front of the oncoming traffic but at the last minute the car accelerated. Next the vehicle started jerking when  placed in reverse. When put in reverse a loud grinding sound and jolting / jumping would occur. The jolt and noise sounded and felt like someone had rear ended the vehicle the moment it was placed in reverse. On 11/6/21 while sitting in traffic I smelled something burning and it seemed to be coming from under my hood. Once I arrived to my destination I opened my hood and looked for any signs of a fire /burning but didn’t notice anything unusual. No warnings were displayed on my vehicle so I brushed it off. Finally on 11/18/21 at 2,965 miles my vehicles powertrain failed. After starting my vehicle and putting it in reverse a loud grinding sound and jump occurred. Once in drive the vehicle began to jerk and had difficulty accelerating. By the time I exited the parking lot a power train failure notice was displayed. Ford replaced the transmission and everything was obviously under warranty. The Ford Pass service record stated the following services were performed: transmission, clutch, axel, other. It is my understanding the entire transmission was replaced. These issues were and still are very concerning given the fact a brand new car experienced power train failure after 2,965 miles.   6/15/23: brakes are ridiculously loud when braking in reverse, brakes make grinding/ scrubbing sound, black break dust on back rims, oh and a new recall for possible fuel injector crack. Rather than addressing the actual fuel injector problem Ford will install a drainage tube to divert fuel away from the engine (*if/ when the fuel injector cracks) and add engenie software to alert drivers when fuel rail pressure has dropped.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'I bought my 2021 Ford Escape in June 2021 new. Shortly after I bought it, I started to hear a really loud screeching sound, very similar to a train coming to a screeching halt, whenever I reversed my car. I brought it into an Illinois ford dealership and they said nothing was wrong with it. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice in the mail about a warranty for the back brakes. Thinking that I solved my issue, I brought my car into a different dealership in Michigan  and had them fix the brake pads. To my dismay and frustration, the brakes still made the terrible sound. I asked the folks why it was still making that sound and they said it was normal. A car backing up should never make that sound. Not only is it terrible sounding but it seems like a major safety concern. The Michigan dealership said that the brakes can make a squealing noise anytime their is condensation on the brake pads, mainly due to the fact that the brakes/brake pads have some sort of metal material in them. I decided to move up the food chain and call the corporate ford office but they couldn’t help me either. Which brought me to filing a formal complaint and seeing what you all can do to help me out. There are several folks out their on the internet that are having the same loud squealing noise as me and are being told it is “nothing wrong.” But a normal car SHOULD NOT BE making those sounds. Please let me know if you can assist.',\n",

I have informed the salesperson Finn Orwig of this situation over the last 7-8 months.  His service department tightened the hood rubber closing stops to no avail.  I went online and plugged in 2021 Ford Escape hood noise and was directed to several online Ford forums where many others are stating the same issue. (See Reddit & Ford Escape hood troubles). I continued to contact Corwin Ford Customer Relationship Center of this issue and filed a complaint on October, 16, 2021.  I never heard back until I reached back to them on February, 23,2022. Peyton gave me an address to send a letter.  Dissatisfied that I could not speak to a representative who I could discuss issue with.  So I then set up a meeting to drive with a rep from Corwin so they could witness the issue first hand.  Before this meeting I sent a letter dated April 11, 22 to both Corwin Ford and Ford customer relations center.  Then on Mon., April 25,22, President of Corwin took drive in vehicle and he agreed with issue but said he could do nothing that it’s a Ford manufacturer issue(talk about customer service).  Once again called Ford customer service who verified they received my letter and was assured I’d get a return call back.  I’m concerned with such dynamic pressures that hood may fail and cause an accident besides the absurd noise.  My next move is to take it to different dealership since still under warranty.  I believe it’s a aero dynamic manufacturer defect.  Other owners have same issues. Hood is component.  Besides noise & vibration hood failure is concern. Vibration & noise confirmed by Corwin Ford President Justin Russell.  Corwin Ford looked at hood and JUST adjusted hood latch bumpers.  I’m planning a visit different Ford Dealership.

It seems to me that the power brakes might have failed. After crashing my brakes seem to go back to normal but still felt abnormally stiff. There was no injuries in the accident. The car is under an open recall stating this exact problem. I contacted our local dealer the day I found out about the recall and they told me that the car was to drive and parts would not be available until the 2nd Quarter of 2022. The recall also states that it only happened under certain circumstances. I will not be driving the vehicle until after recall is fixed because it is an unsafe vehicle to drive due to not knowing when the brakes might fail again.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"I rented this Ford Escape from Avis this month and ran into what could have been an incredibly dangerous safety issue due to a massive oversight in the car's design.   I installed a small booster seat in the passenger side back seat for my 10 year-old son. He got in the seat and attached his seat belt, which he has done hundreds of times before in our own car.   About 1 hour into a 2-hour freeway trip, a notification went off on the dashboard, telling me that a seat belt in the back had come undone. My son tried frantically to reattach the buckle but was unable. I had to exit the freeway and park on the side of the road.  When I tried to reattach the buckle, I saw why there was a problem: He had inserted the buckle into the CENTER receptacle, not the passenger-side one. The receptacle didn't click, as it was probably designed not to do, but because the metal of the buckle has a slight angle to it, there was enough tension for it to temporarily hold. However even a minor accident could have been fatal because my son wasn't property strapped in.   There are several issues here. First, the dash indicator should have been designed to tell me that there was weight on the right rear seat but no buckle was attached to that receptacle.   Second, the center receptacle did not immediately reject the right-most buckle; instead, the bent angle of the buckle's metal temporarily held it in place and made my 10 year-old believe he was strapped in.   Finally, the receptacles themselves have no play from side-to-side. This, plus the angle of the buckle's metal, means that when a booster seat is installed, there is not enough room to fully attach the buckle into the receptacle without exerting a LOT of force to push the receptacle to the left.  I can't imagine the buckle can be attached at all with a larger child seat. The image I attached shows why this is; attaching a car seat requires exerting enough force to bend the metal holding the receptacle in order to attach the buckle.\",\n",
